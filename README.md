Q1 Answer 
a. Arithmetic operators symbols

   + addition operator
   - subtraction operator
   * multiplication operator
   / division operator
   ** exponentiation operator
   % modulo operator
   ++ increment operator 
   -- decrement operator 
   ++x Pre-increment operator 
   x++ Post-increment operator 
   --x Pre-Decrement operator 
   x-- Post-Decrement operator


b. Assignment operators symbols

   =  assignment
   += addition assignment
   -= subtraction assignment
   *= multiplicatio assignment
   /= division assignment
   %= modulus and assignment

c. comparison operator

   > greater than
   >= greater than or equal to
   < less than
   <= less than or equal to
   != not equal to
   !== not equal equal to
   == loose equality (double equals)
   === strict equality (triple equals)

d. Logical operator

   &&  AND
   || OR
   !  NOT

e. Bitwise operator
   &  AND
   |  OR
   ^  XOR
   -  NOT

 Q2 Answer

a. Egs of Arithmetic operators symbols
   let a = 10;
   let b = 4;
   console.log (a - b);
   console.log (a + b);


b. Egs of Assignment operators symbols
   let d = 10;
   d = d / 2 // answer is 5;
   console.log(d);

   let p = p * 6 // let p *= 6;

c. Egs of comparison operator

   console.log(a >= b);
   console.log(b > a);

d. Egs of Logical operator
   let a = 3;
   let b = 4;
   console.log( a && b);
   console.log( a || b);

e. Egs of Bitwise operator
   let a = 3;
   let b = 4;
   console.log( a & b);
   console.log( a ^ b);

Q4 Answer

for (let i = 1; i < 20; i += 7) {
   console.log(i);
The result is 
1
8
15
